# Introduction to Captide

Captide enables organisations to deploy multi-agent architectures, embed AI across their financial workflows, and distil insights from millions of corporate filings—all without the complexity of designing or maintaining RAG infrastructure. It streamlines data extraction, investment research, and document review—accessible through a user-friendly interface at [app.captide.co](www.captide.co) or directly via API.

This documentation is your guide to integrating the Captide API and leveraging our specialized AI agent, built to deliver accurate, document-grounded financial insights in response to natural language queries. The AI scans thousands of filings to surface the most relevant answers, currently supporting SEC-related content and international companies listed with the SEC. Our coverage is rapidly expanding to new regions and document types.

## Core Functionalities

- Extract structured or unstructured insights from disclosures of publicly listed companies.
- Seamlessly compare and consolidate information across multiple sources and entities.
- Audit any metric or insight with traceable source links for full transparency and context.
- Build custom datasets, peer benchmarks, insight trackers, and more.

## Core Components

- **REST API**:
  - **Document Snippets Endpoint**: Retrieve relevant document excerpts and metadata tailored to user queries.
  - **Streaming Endpoint**: Receive real-time, AI-generated answers via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
